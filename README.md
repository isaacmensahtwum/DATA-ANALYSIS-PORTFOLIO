## Portfolio Projects
### 1. Python
- Sales Analysis for Retail Stores <br>
    **Goal:** To identify product categories whose sales trend over time have declined and identify key reasons for such decline.<br>
    
    **Code:** [Business Metrics-Sales Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/isaacmensahtwum/Data-Analysis-with-Python/blob/b8e858a11f1dbecaf1543cd31191dbf20dca71c7/Business%20Metrics%20-%20Sales%20Analysis.ipynb) <br>
    
    **Method:** The dataset contains 30 variables including unit price, quantity sold, product categories, and competitor prices. It spans for 2 consecutive years.
                  Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization.<br>
                  
    **Results:** The sales analysis revealed a decrease in revenue for four product categories, bath products, game consoles, cool stuff, and garden tools in 2018 compared to the previous year. Analyzing the competitor prices highlighted higher average prices for bath products, cool products, and garden tools in 2018 compared to their competitors, indicating a potential influence on customer decision-making.<br>
    
    **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, seaborn<br>
    
    **Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.<br>

- Movie Recommendation System (Machine Learning)
  
    **Goal:** Recommender systems have become integral to various online platforms, providing personalized suggestions to users across a wide range of entities such as products, movies, and services. Examples include Amazon's product recommendations, Netflix's movie suggestions, and YouTube's video recommendations. In this project, my focus is on building a Content-based movie recommendation system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. By analyzing textual features such as movie descriptions, genres, and titles, I aim to recommend movies that share similar characteristics with specific movies of interest tailored toward user preferences and tastes.
  
    **Code:** [Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/isaacmensahtwum/Data-Analysis-with-Python/blob/b8e858a11f1dbecaf1543cd31191dbf20dca71c7/Movie%20Recommendation%20System.ipynb)
  
    **Description:** The dataset contains 4803 entries with 20 columns. Movie titles, taglines, genres, overviews and popularity were utilized to generate the recommendation function. Data cleaning and missing values. Basic text pre-processing, feature engineering and document similarity computation were done.
  
    **Results:** The movie recommendation function successfully generates top 5 recommendations for each given movie title in the dataset. For instance, for the movie "Minions", the recommended movies include "Despicable Me 2", "Despicable Me", "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows", "Superman", and "Rise of the Guardians". Similarly, for "Interstellar", recommended movies are "Gattaca", "Space Cowboys", "Space Pirate Captain Harlock", "Starship Troopers", and "Final Destination 2". These recommendations are derived from the movie metadata, enabling the system to suggest similar movies based on their textual descriptions.
  
    **Libraries:** nltk, re, pandas, numpy, TfidfVectorizer, cosine_similarity (sklearn feature_extraction)
 
    **Skills:** Natural language processing, Machine learning, unstructured data, predictive modelling.
